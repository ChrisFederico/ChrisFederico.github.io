					<h1>Path to User</h1><br>
                    <h2>Network scan</h2><br>
                    <p>I began scanning the network:</p>
                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/overpass/nmap.PNG">
                    </div><br>
                    
                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/overpass/2gobuster.PNG">
                    </div><br>

                    <p>There were the SSH service on <b>port 22</b> and an Apache webserver on port 80.<br>
                        Since port 80 was open I tried to enumerate some directories using <b>gobuster</b> and I found the
                        admin panel on /admin path.
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <p>The admin panel had a simple form with username and password. First thing I tried was entering some <b>default
                        credentials</b> like "admin:admin", "administrator:administrator" and some weak passwords like "overpass" etc.
                        Then I tried different kinds of attack like <b>SQL Injections</b> or <b>XSS scripting</b> but none of them had success. 
                    </p><br>

                    <p>I had a look in Firefox dev tools in order to understand the behavior of the website when I entered the credentials.
                        I was lucky enough to spot a <b>login.js</b> file which was located in the webserver's root directory. 
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/overpass/3loginadmin.PNG" width="60%">
                    </div><br>

                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/overpass/4login_js.PNG" width="60%">
                    </div><br>

                    <p>By opening the login.js file I found a piece of source code for the login page. I had no doubts this was the
                        initial foothold I needed.
                    </p><br>

                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/overpass/5login_js_src.PNG">
                    </div><br>

                    <p>I highlighted the piece of code I had to hack: in order to get to the /admin location I had to set a cookie
                        on my browser. The steps I followed were the following:<br>
                        - setup <b>Burp Suite</b><br>
                        - intercept a response from the webserver<br>
                        - set a session cookie for this website<br>
                        - <b>exploit!</b><br> 
                    </p><br>

                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/overpass/6burp1.PNG"><br>
                        <small><i>The request from my browser</i></small>
                    </div><br>

                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/overpass/6burp2.PNG"><br>
                        <small><i>The server response</i></small>
                    </div><br>

                    <p>The trick was to set a <i>location</i> parameter to <b>/admin</b> and cancel the "Incorrect Credentials" from
                        the intercepted response. This way I had a cookie in my session on the website, this should have allowed me
                        to bypass the <b>if statement</b> on the login.js function.
                    </p><br>

                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/overpass/7cookie1.PNG">
                        <img class="ml-1" src="/assets/writeups_img/overpass/7cookie2.PNG">
                    </div><br>

                    <p>Now, as you can see in the picture, I had a cookie in my session and as I <b>reloaded the page</b> I entered in the admin panel!
                        The login function in the js file received the sessionToken and the the server ran the code in the <b>else statement</b>,
                        so my new location was the /admin directory.  
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/overpass/8id_rsa.PNG">
                    </div><br>

                    <p>In this page there was an <b>RSA key</b>! This was crucial during the walkthrough as it was associated to a username
                        called <b>james</b>. The next step was to decode the key to get a hashed string, then I had to bruteforce the hashed
                        string in order to get the passphrase to use with the RSA key, and get a shell with SSH.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>I first copied the key on a local file and then searched for a couple of tools in order to get the job done,
                        the first one was <a href="https://github.com/openwall/john/blob/bleeding-jumbo/run/ssh2john.py">ssh2john</a>: a python script
                        which reads a private key file and returns a hash string. The second was <a href="https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/john">John The Ripper</a>,
                        which is pre-installed in Kali.     
                    </p><br>

                    <p>The first command was<br>
                    <code>./ssh2john.py id_rsa > id_rsa.crack</code><br>
                        Which returned the hash to crack. This hash was the input for the following command:<br>
                    <code>john id_rsa.crack -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt</code><br>
                    And as I expected I got a passphrase <i>james13</i><br>
                    </p><br>

                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/overpass/9crack_idrsa.PNG">
                    </div><br>

                    <p>All I had to do was to login with SSH using the RSA key using this pass.
                    After I got the shell, the user flag was in the /home/james/ directory.
                    </p><br>

                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/overpass/10usershell.PNG">
                    </div><br>

                    <p>The user flag was right into the home folder for james.
                    </p><br>

                    <hr>
                    <h1>Path to root</h1><br>
                    <h2>Privesc</h2><br>
                    <p>I did some manual enumeration looking for misconfigurations, permissions, etc.<br>
                        I found the vulnerability while listing cronjobs: I noticed a cron running every minute calling a 
                        buildscript.sh file on overpass.thm/downloads/src/ folder; also, the cron was running as root. 
                        This had to be the vulnerability, all I had to do was redirect the target of the cronjob on a malicious script.
                    </p><br>

                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/overpass/11crontab.PNG">
                    </div><br>

                    <p>I searched on /etc/hosts file in order to rename the overpass.thm domain and redirect it towards my ip
                        (for the tun0 interface), then I cancelled all the entries for the ipv4 rules and added a single rule
                        that associated my ip to overpass.thm domain. 
                    </p><br>

                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/overpass/12hosts.PNG"><br>
                        <small><i>Just leave a single rule for x.x.x.x overpass.thm (where x.x.x.x is your THM VPN IP)</i></small>
                    </div><br>

                    <p>The last thing I had to do was make sure that the curl command in the cronjob was actually working. This was
                        pointing to a specific folder, so I had to replicate the exact same path on a local webserver. I tried
                        using<br>
                        <code>php -S localhost:80</code><br>
                        But for some reason it wasn't working as in the log I didn't receive any request from the cron (maybe it wasn't properly an HTTP server), 
                        so I switched to a Python simple HTTP server:<br>
                        <code>sudo python3 -m http.server 80</code>    
                    </p><br>

                    <p>Also I had to craft the malicious script in order to get the root access; I wrote a simple bash script that
                        copied /bin/bash executable into /tmp folder and gave SUID permissions (so I could run it as root). Obviously
                        the script had to be called as the name specified in the cronjob, so this was my <i>buildscript.sh</i>.                        
                    </p><br>

                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/overpass/13exploiting_cron2.PNG">
                    </div><br>

                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/overpass/13exploiting_cron1.PNG">
                    </div><br>

                    <p>As expected after less than a minute the cronjob started and sent a request on my HTTP server at the /downloads/src/buildscript.sh
                        path, but this time it executed <b>my</b> malicious script and as I checked on my user SSH shell, listing the /tmp folder I found
                        my malicious executable.                         
                    </p><br>

                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/overpass/13exploiting_cron3.PNG">
                    </div><br>

                    <p>So the last thing to do was to run the script using:<br>
                    <code>/tmp/rootbash -p</code><br>
                    This granted me root access and I got the root flag from /root folder.
                    </p>

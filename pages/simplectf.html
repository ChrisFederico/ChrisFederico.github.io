					<h1>Path to User</h1><br>
                    <h2>Network scan</h2><br>
                    <p>As always I started using <b>nmap</b> in order to find open ports and services:</p>
                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/simplectf/nmap.PNG">
                    </div><br>
                    
                    <p>There's the SSH service on <b>port 2222</b>, FTP on 21 and an Apache webserver on port 80.<br>
                        I tried to find some hint using ftp, since it allowed anonymous login, but I didn't find anything useful; same thing
                        for the webserver since it only had the standard Apache landing page.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>The next step was looking for directories into the webserver, so I used a tool called <a href="https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch">dirsearch</a>. I prefer
                        this rather than gobuster or dir, also because none of them managed to find anything. Anyway...this was the output of the
                        command, I noticed that there was a directory called <b>simple</b>, which led me to a <b>CMS Made Simple</b> page.
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/simplectf/dirsearch.PNG">
                    </div><br>
                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/simplectf/cmssimple.PNG" width="60%">
                    </div><br>

                    <p>This had to be the initial foothold somehow, so I dig into the website looking for useful informations; the first
                        thing was to determine the version of the CMS, so I looked into the source code and I found that it was obsolete!
                    </p><br>

                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/simplectf/version.PNG">
                    </div><br>

                    <p>I was pretty sure this version was still vulnerable so I searched for common exploits with <b>searchsploit</b>. I found
                        a Python script which exploited a vulnerability to SQL Injections. <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46635">This</a>
                        was the exploit I used and <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9053">this</a> is the CVE reference I found. You
                        can see the exploits is based on Time-based SQL Injections.
                    </p><br>

                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/simplectf/searchsploit.PNG">
                    </div><br>

                    <strong><b>NOTE</b>: I'm always hesitant while solving CTFs based on CVE without knowing what kind of vulnerability I'm exploiting
                        and how the exploit actually works. I will provide a more detailed explanation about how the attack worked as soon as possible.  
                    </strong><br>

                    <p>Back to business...This was the output of the exploit (I hope you have better luck than me with python settings, since I had to make
                        this thing work with python3...But long-story-short: if you have trouble while you are trying to run this exploit with python command,
                        I used <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html">this tool</a> in order to convert it to python3 and somehow it worked).
                        The tool managed to find username and passwords! So I ran the command using <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt">this wordlist</a>.<br>
                        <code sourceCode="python">
                            python3 46635.py -u x.x.x.x/simple/ --crack -w worst110.txt                              
                        </code><br>
                        <b>(Obviously replace x.x.x.x with the ip address of your virtual instance)</b><br> 
                        ...Aaand here's the output:
                    </p>

                    </div><br>
		
                    <p>From this point I could login with mitch's credentials on SSH and get a user shell. The command is:
                        <code>ssh mitch@x.x.x.x -p 2222</code> (always remember to replace the ip, <b>and to specify the port with the -p option</b>, 
                        since is running on a different port from standard)
                    </p><br>

                        <img src="/assets/writeups_img/simplectf/ssh.PNG">
                    </div><br>

                    <p>Just cat the content of user.txt in order to get the user flag!</p><br>

                    <hr>
                    <h1>Path to root</h1><br>
                    <h2>Privesc</h2><br>
                    <p>The root part was much more easier but you have to know how to enumerate on a local machine. So always have at hand
                        a cheatsheet if you forget some commands. After a while I ran <code>sudo -l</code> in order to list what mitch
                        can do with root privileges: turned out that <b>vim</b> was executable without using password.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>Another tool I had was <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/">GTFOBins</a>. Here you can find all sorts of
                        permissions exploits. In my case, the command I had to run was:
                        <code>sudo vim -c ':!/bin/bash'</code><br>
                        This command spawns a root shell during startup, before opening the editor (check <a href="https://renenyffenegger.ch/notes/development/vim/editing/start-up/command-line-options">here</a> for details).                  
                    </p><br>
